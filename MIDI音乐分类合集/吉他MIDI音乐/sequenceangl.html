<p align="center"><font size="5">Tips for a MIDI Sequence Realization</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Selection of instrument</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">The first thing to do, at the beginning of a MIDI sequence, is
to set an instrument for each track used by the sequence. Otherwise, unexpected
results may arise because the last instrument used on the previous sequence may
be left over. This site being dedicated to classical guitar, the nylon guitar
(number 25 or 24 depending on the MIDI software used) should be chosen. Another
instrument could also be selected provided the presence of the guitar is ensured, for
example:&nbsp; guitar-violin, guitar-flute duets, guitar + orchestra. MIDI files
made with only one instrument different of guitar will not be accepted.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Volume setting</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Next, the volume should be set to maximum.
Failing to follow that rule is a problem since I receive many nearly inaudible
MIDI sequences.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Sequencing the right tempo</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Try to make a MIDI sequence at the right tempo.
If you are not sure of the tempo of a song, try whenever possible to listen to a
professional performer's recording.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Other parameters: reverb, panoramic</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Make use of these controls. Utilisation of&nbsp; reverb
adds another dimension to your MIDI sequence. Utilisation of panoramic control
can be useful: when using two tracks or more (or two instruments or more), think
about sequencing one in the left speaker and the second one in the right
speaker, this will add spatial dimension to the MIDI.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Sequencing in the right octave</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4" color="#000000">&quot;This is a very important
side of classical guitar MIDI sequencing realization. One must remember that the
guitar is a transposing instrument, it sounds one octave lower than its written&nbsp;
music in the G clef. Thus, it is necessary to always transpose the sequenced
guitar staff down one octave to obtain the actual guitar sound (otherwise, you
will be one octave too high). This is a common mistake of the MIDI that I
receive. Your classical guitar MIDI must sound the closest possible to the true
instrument. As a rule, there are two ways to carry that transposition to one
lower octave: one can use the G clef shifted down one octave (a G clef with a
small &quot;8&quot; under it) and enter the notes of your score as they are.
This is by far the simplest method to use provided your MIDI editor has that
possibility. For the second way, use a normal G clef (unshifted) but block all
the notes already processed and transpose them down one octave. Using the two
ways allows to transpose the entered score down one octave and hence you obtain
the guitar MIDI sound at the right octave.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>The quality of the MIDI sound</b></font></p>
<div>
  <font size="4">The MIDI sound obtained will always be poor and unpleasant if
  you only enter, as they appear, the notes of a score, the reason for this being
  that musical notation is in fact a simplification of the actual sound of an
  instrument. Let's take for example a C major arpeggio of four notes for classical
  guitar. The score will simply show us C, E, G, C but, in fact, the C note is still
  heard when one plays the E note, the C and E notes can still be heard when the
  G note is played. the C, E and G notes are still heard when you play the final C
  note. Listen to this small <a href="Sequence_Arpege.mid">MIDI</a>
  given as example.&nbsp; The two first MIDI arpeggios in C major have been made
  by entering only what is on the score (C, E, G, C) but for the two last
  arpeggios, care has been taken to make the notes sound as a true guitar would.
  Therefore, MIDI sequencing is an art consisting of score notes interpretation
  and programming the sound the closest way possible to realty.</font>
</div>
<p align="left"><font size="4">A good and efficient method that will give a
pleasant MIDI sound consists in entering the score notes on many tracks or
staves . Lets imagine, for example, a classical guitar song with arpeggios. One
would easily spot three voices: the bass notes that can be heard all the time,
the accompaniment notes (arpeggios) and the song notes (for example the
high-pitched notes on the E string). In that kind of song, one would enter the
bass notes on a first voice, the arpeggio notes on a second voice and the song
notes on a third voice. Or create as well a special score (on three distinct
tracks). This special score thus created cannot be read by a
guitarist but the goal is not the reading but the creation of the closest
possible MIDI sound to the real nylon guitar's sound. Listen to this small <a href="Sequence_Melodie.mid">melody</a>
given as example. The first interpretation has been made with all the notes on
the same voice, it is very dull. The second interpretation, on three distinct
voices: bass, accompaniment notes, and song notes. It gives a much better result
close to a true guitar playing. In the third interpretation, the notes duration
is at maximum (if your MIDI editor has a feature allowing a maximum duration to
the notes, set it to 100% in order to obtain a continuous sound or for those
having an advanced MIDI editor, set a legato* function on all the score), the song notes
have been put in a prominent state (volume risen a little bit higher than for
the other notes), the arpeggios sound better (their notes sound as in true
guitar playing), the final chord has been played as an arpeggio in order to
simulate a professional performing.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>About legato</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">The linking of sounds is called
&quot;legato&quot;. When a note is entered whatever way in a MIDI editor, its
written duration on the score doesn't correspond to its real duration as read by
the system. It is a little bit less, in general 80% of its written
duration on the score. Thus, there are some very small pauses between each
notes. The legato utilisation consists in removing of those sound interruptions,
therefore the played notes duration will be virtually equal to their duration on
the written score, we are thus much closer to the guitar playing. It must be
clear that this assertion is true only for nylon guitar (MIDI No.24 or 25
depending of editors). When&nbsp; MIDI editing is applied to nylon guitar, the
sound ends between&nbsp; each note while it is not at all the same situation
with held notes such as with bowed instruments (as violin), the winds or the
human voices. Try the following experience: Tie five or six consecutive wholes
and listen to the result for nylon guitar. After the fifth or sixth beat, with
an ordinary tempo, one doesn't no longer hear anything while with a bowed
instrument, the sound is perfectly audible up to 80% of its duration. Let's note
that for the harp (MIDI No.47), the legato would be less necessary since the
synthesizer makes a string continue to vibrate with the following note, in
opposition to the guitar. If one enter a serie of eight notes and compares the
result with guitar and with harp, he wil hear a continuous sound with the harp
but a discontinuous one with guitar. The goal of the legato is therefore to
adapt the note duration to realty and to hear a continuous sound in conformity
with classical guitar.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>About chord sequencing</b></font></p>
<div>
  <font size="4">In scores, the chords are written as superimposed notes. However,
  when one plays guitar, these notes are often performed one after the other or played in fast arpeggios and thus are not&nbsp; simultananeously
  played. This chord arpeggio is sequenced by using the 32th note (or
  64th note) for the speed of the arpeggio. Let's take for example the C
  major chord: C, E, G, C. You would write the 5th string C as a 32nd note. Just
  after, you write the 4th string E as a 32th note and include again the 5th
  string C and tie it to the first C. Then, you write the 4th string G in 32nd
  note and include the E and the C, both of which are tied to the preceding notes. Finally, we
  write the high C (2nd string) as a 32th note and the G, the E and the low C
  are included and tied to the preceeding notes as before (see <b>fig.1</b>). If the C chord
  were a quarter
  note, you would complete it by using 8th notes tied to the preceding
  notes <b>(fig.1)</b>.&nbsp;In the following figure, the chord has a total
  duration equal to a dotted quarter note. As a result, the arpeggio of C has
  been completed with a quarter note (four 32th note + one 4th note = one 4th
  note and a half).</font>
  <p><font size="4">Listen to the <a href="Accord_arpege.mid">following
  chords</a>, the first ones are played simultaneously (MIDI notes superimposed)
  then, the same series of chords is played as arpeggios. Note that it is
  sometimes good to tie the upper note of a chord to the following notes
  especially in the case of an open string that continues to vibrate
  while you change the fingering. In the case of two superimposed notes in a
  score, for example a bass and a treble note, it is sometimes good to let the
  bass note ring through the treble note. Visually, the score becomes more complex
  by the presence of those tied supplementary notes but the resulting sound is
  closer to realty.</font>
